# YOU HAVE TO CONFIGURE THIS PROGRAM FOR YOURSELF!
Mostly because it depends on your monitor size and country you want to gain xp on - **Andorra recomended!**

1. Launch `find_cordinates.py` and copy the outcome

2. Paste the outcome in the `congif.json` and add variables as such:

{
    "POSITON":"100, 110",
}

3. You should be ready! (At least if you didn't srew up something...)
